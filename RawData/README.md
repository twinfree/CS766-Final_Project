Dcm files are too large to upload so we link them here: Link to MATCH Dataset https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Pv9dusbPRgytFiyxII02gtJTWZrMAKWh.

I have provided some scripts for reading in dcm files.  
    readintratreatment.m is a script for reading in a stack of 2D projection xray images taken during treatment delivery.  
    read4DCT.m is a script for reading in a CT scan with time varying gray values.  
    Generate4DMask.m is a script for generating a 4D mask of the tumor from the RT structure set of a 4D CT planning CT
